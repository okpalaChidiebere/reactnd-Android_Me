# Android Me

AndroidMe is an app that lets you style your own Android by customizing it's hair and clothing! It uses Fragments, modular sections of an Activity, to create a flexible and responsive UI.

- I learned and uses the power of reusability and modularity in react-native!
- I learned how to dynamically create and re-render components to build a responsive and dynamic UI

** One thing i kinda brush off and did not implement well, was the margin and padding of the FLatList. You can look at that later. This [link](https://snack.expo.io/embedded/@aboutreact/example-of-grid-view-in-react-native?preview=true&platform=ios&iframeId=44f1tkotsc&theme=dark) might help. **

This [link](https://www.neekey.net/2017/01/23/responsive-master-detail-layout-in-react/) implememted MasterDetail in normal react. You can use that for your react project. In this project we implemented Master-Detail flow for react-native
